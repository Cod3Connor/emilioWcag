        <h1>How to Spot</h1>
        <p>To identify human trafficking, watch for signs like fearful or controlled behavior, inconsistent stories, 
            lack of identification, and physical abuse indicators. Be alert to situations where someone is closely monitored 
            or unable to speak freely. If you suspect trafficking, contact local authorities or anti-trafficking hotlines while
            avoiding direct confrontation.

        <h1>Stats</h1>
        <p>Human trafficking is a grave global issue, with approximately 25 million people trapped in forced labor and commercial
            sexual exploitation, according to the ILO. Women and girls make
            up around 71% of the victims. The UNODC highlights the immense profitability of this crime, generating about $150 billion in
            profits each year, emphasizing the critical importance of concerted actions to combat and eliminate human trafficking.</p>
